# Welcome to the New Relic One Catalog application submission process

With the release of the [`New Relic One Catalog`](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/new-programmability-features/), customers gained the ability to install third-party, open-source and partner applications into their `New Relic One` accounts with just a few clicks.

If you're a developer who wants to add an application to the catalog, this repository is your entry point.

## About the `nr1-catalog` repository

`nr1-catalog` is a repository of `submodules` that each links to a Nerdpack (custom application) designed to fit into the New Relic One Catalog. This repository contains three main components:

- A collection of `submodules` that each point to a New Relic One application in a separate `git` repository.
- [Automation](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-catalog/tree/master/.github) to verify PRs and promote `submodules` to the New Relic One Catalog on a merge to the `nr1-catalog master` branch.
- Instructions for submitting projects to the New Relic One Catalog as well as this site's documentation on the standards for catalog projects.

## Process for Submitting Code to the New Relic One Catalog

The following is the high-level process for submitting code to the `nr1-catalog` and having your application available for global installation in the New Relic One Catalog.
