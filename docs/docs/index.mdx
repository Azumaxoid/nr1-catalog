This repository is meant to be a repository of `submodules` that each represent a codebase designed to fit into the New Relic One Catalog. The repository contains three main components:

1. A collection of `submodules` each containing an New Relic One application.
2. `GitHub Action` automation to handle the verification of PR's and promotion of `submodules` to the `New Relic One Catalog` on a merge to the `master` branch.
3. Documentation on the standard(s) for `New Relic One Catalog` projects.
